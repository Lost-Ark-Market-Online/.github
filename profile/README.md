# Lost Ark Market Online
The LAMO project aims to aid the Lost Ark players that want tools for better trading providing a croud sourced data gathering platform.

Players can volunteer to become market watchers and post the market information into our database by using the watcher-app. 

The watcher app is an OCR based app that reads screenshots taken by our watchers and post the processed information into the database.

We then use that information and publicly share it through the [Lost Ark Market Online Website](https://www.lostarkmarket.online) and through the [public API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/20821530/UyxbppKr).
